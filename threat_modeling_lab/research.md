---

##### **Use Case 1: Upload a Video**

![1738873115204](image/research/1738873115204.png)

1. **User** submits a video through the **Video Upload API**.
2. The video is sent to the **Video Uploading Server**.
3. The video is processed by the **Video Processing Queue**.
4. The processed video is stored in the **Video Object Store**.
5. Metadata about the video is saved in the **Database**.

---

##### **Use Case 2: Stream a Video**

![1738877121620](image/research/1738877121620.png)

1. **User** requests a video through the **Video Stream API**.
2. The **Application Server** retrieves the video metadata from the **Database**.
3. The **Application Server** fetches the video file from the **Video Object Store**.
4. The video is streamed to the **User**.

---

##### **Use Case 3: Search for Videos**

![1738877178837](image/research/1738877178837.png)

1. **User** submits a search query through the **Search API**.
2. The **Application Server** queries the **Database** for matching videos.
3. The **Application Server** returns the search results to the **User**.

### **2. Determine Threats**

#### **2.1 STRIDE Threat Categorization**

STRIDE is a model for identifying security threats:

- **S**poofing
- **T**ampering
- **R**epudiation
- **I**nformation Disclosure
- **D**enial of Service
- **E**levation of Privilege

#### **2.2 Threats Summary Table**

Below is a summary of threats, vulnerabilities, scores, and countermeasures:

| **Asset**               | **Category**     | **Threat**                                                     | **Vulnerability**                                             | **Score** | **Countermeasure**                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User Credentials**    | Spoofing               | Attackers impersonate users by stealing credentials.                 | Weak password policies or plaintext password storage.               | 8.5             | Enforce strong passwords, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), and hash passwords.       |
| **Video Objects**       | Tampering              | Attackers modify or replace video files.                             | Lack of integrity checks on video files.                            | 7.2             | Use cryptographic hashes to verify file integrity.                                         |
| **User Data**           | Information Disclosure | Attackers access sensitive user data (e.g., email, profile picture). | Insecure API endpoints or lack of encryption.                       | 9.1             | Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest, and implement proper access controls.       |
| **System Availability** | Denial of Service      | Attackers overload the system, making it unavailable.                | Lack of rate limiting or DDoS protection.                           | 8.8             | Implement rate limiting, use a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and deploy DDoS protection. |
| **Comments**            | Repudiation            | Users deny posting malicious comments.                               | Lack of logging or auditing for comment actions.                    | 6.5             | Implement logging and auditing for all comment actions.                                    |
| **Admin Dashboard**     | Elevation of Privilege | Attackers gain admin access and control the system.                  | Weak authentication or authorization mechanisms for admin accounts. | 9.3             | Use role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce strong authentication for admins.         |

---

#### **3.3 Recommendations**

- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Use logging and auditing to detect and respond to malicious activities.
- Regularly update and patch system components to address vulnerabilities.
- Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing.
